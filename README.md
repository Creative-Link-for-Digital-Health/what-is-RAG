# What is RAG?

A quick presentation on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)


## So really... what is it?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI framework that enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by combining them with information retrieval systems. RAG addresses key limitations of traditional LLMs by:

- **Providing up-to-date information**: Unlike LLMs trained on static datasets, RAG can access current information
- **Improving factual accuracy**: By grounding responses in retrieved relevant data
- **Enabling domain-specific expertise**: Connecting LLMs to specialized knowledge bases
- **Reducing hallucinations**: Providing factual context to generate more reliable outputs


## Technical Architecture

The presentation covers the fundamental components of RAG systems:

```
User Query → Information Retrieval → Context Integration → LLM Processing → Enhanced Response
```

### Core Components
1. **Vector Databases**: Store and index knowledge base content
2. **Embedding Models**: Convert text to searchable vector representations  
3. **Retrieval Systems**: Find relevant information based on user queries
4. **Large Language Models**: Generate contextually-aware responses
5. **Integration Layer**: Coordinate between retrieval and generation components

## Implementation Considerations in the Healthcare Context

### Privacy and Security
- Patient data protection and HIPAA compliance
- Secure handling of sensitive medical information
- Local deployment options for sensitive healthcare environments

### Quality Assurance
- Validation of retrieved medical information
- Source attribution and citation tracking
- Continuous monitoring for accuracy and bias

### Integration Challenges
- EHR system compatibility
- Workflow integration in clinical settings
- User training and adoption strategies


## Getting Started

### Setting Up the Environment

This project includes interactive Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate RAG concepts and implementations. Follow these steps to set up your local environment:

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Creative-Link-for-Digital-Health/what-is-RAG.git
cd what-is-RAG
```

#### 2. Create Conda Environment
```bash
# Create a new conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate the environment
conda activate RAG-presentation
```
